1a2-pic

This is the PIC chip firmware for a 1A2 Multiline Phone Control Board (REV D and up),
which uses a PIC16F1709 to manage hardware logic on the PCB, in place of analog/discrete components
used in earlier versions of the printed circuit board (REV A, B, C).

1A2 business phone systems were common in the 1950's-1980's, and some people still like
using these rugged multiline phones which can be integrated with modern technology;
IP telephones, Cellphones (via Bluetooth gateway devices), etc.

This 1A2 Multiline Phone Control Board (a single printed circuit board) handles doing
what AT&T's original KSU boxes (Key System Unit) do, which are large and heavy and
somewhat complicated to install. The smallest of AT&T's boxes were steel, about the size
of a large shoe box, and had several PCB boards in a rack, a punch block, heavy power supplies,
motor powered rotary switches, etc.

There is a website for this 1A2 circuit board here:

..which as of this writing shows the REV B version of the board with discrete components (no PIC chip),
but there is a temporary "R&D development" page for the new PIC chip version of these boards here (REV D+E):

..which shows the current status of the PCBs, schematics, documentation, etc.
