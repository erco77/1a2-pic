                =========================================================
                1A2 KSU BOARD - REV-G1 - 2 LINE / 4 EXTENSIONS / INTERLINK
                =========================================================
                erco@seriss.com - 1.0 (REV-G1) Jun 29 2019

                <I><B>If you find problems in this document, contact: erco@seriss.com</B></I>

                NOTE: In REV-G1, R28 (10K) and R27 (300/1W) component numbers were swapped,
                      so that now R28 is the 300/1W, and R27 is the 10K.

                      In REV-H, new onboard fuse added, removed JP1 and JP2

                      In REV-J, TIP32 (Q6), R25 and R27 were dropped, and replaced with
                                C8 and C9.


1.0 OVERVIEW OF THE 1A2 BOARD AND FEATURES
==========================================

    This board allows one to attach up to 4 separate 1A2 "6 button" phones
    for up to 2 separate telco lines, and provides these common 1A2 features
    with simple "straight wiring":

        o Up to 4 separate extensions

        o 2 telco lines, each with Hold feature

        o Lamps: o Blink when line is ringing
                 o On steady when in use
                 o Wink when on hold

        o Programmable ringing (ring generator must be supplied by user)

        o Optional 'buzz ringing' which uses buzzers instead of bells to ring phones
          (e.g. if no ring generator is present)

        o Intercom on line 5, with extension buzzing via Touch-Tone or Rotary

        o 2 boards can be linked with a 30 pin ribbon cable for 4 lines / 8 Extensions

        o In a power outage, phones can still be used to dial out

        o Handles remote hangups during hold (CPC signal from CO)

    The intercom line allows a caller to buzz any of the 4 extensions by
    dialing the extension number on either a Rotary or Touch-Tone dial pad.
    This signals the person at that extension to pick up the intercom to talk
    to the caller. Dialing "0" buzzes all extensions.

    The system is also expandable: with two boards, they can can be joined
    with a 30 pin ribbon cable to provide a total of 4 CO lines, and 8 extensions.
    Intercom is also expanded so that one can dial 1 through 8 to buzz any of 
    the 8 extensions, and "0" to buzz all 8.

4.0 ELECTRICAL DESCRIPTION
==========================

    This section describes the electrical design considerations.

    Refer to separate schematic and circuit board for actual circuit layout.

    4.0 Design Approach
    --------------------

    When desiging this 1A2 control circuit, I started with the circuits
    that interface with the telco line:

        o Detect ringing (for 1A2 lamps and ringers)
        o Detect if a line is in use (for 1A2 lamps and hold)
        o Remote hangup detection: "Calling Party Control" or CPC signals
        o Holding a call

    NOTE IN THE FOLLOWING:
    * Since the Line 1 circuit is exactly the same as Line 2's circuit,
    * to keep the circuit description simple, we focus on just one line,
    * Line 1's components and signal names.

    Let's start with the Detect signals first.

    LDA-110 "AC input" optocouplers are used for detecting both
    Ring Detect and Line Detect. These optocouplers have AC input LEDs
    and darlington transistors with an open collector output, which makes
    them perfect for this purpose.

        4.1.1 "Ring Detect": Detects Ringing
        ------------------------------------
        An optocoupler connected across Tip and Ring can be used to detect
        the presence of AC ring voltage. An R/C filter was used in earlier
        versions of the board to remove noise during zero crossing of the
        AC ring signal, but this hardware was removed in the PIC chip versions
        of the board, implementing the equivalent in the PIC firmware.

        As soon as a valid ring signal is detected, the firmware detects
        ringing and passes the ring generator's current to the 1A2 phones
        programmed for ringing via the SW2 diode matrix.

        4.1.2 "Line Detect": Detect Line Use
        ------------------------------------
        The telco's Tip and Ring wires are monitored for current flow via
        the Line Detect optocoupler, wired in series with the telco's "Ring" wire.
        When the extensions are all idle for the line, there is no current flow
        through Tip/Ring.

        When someone picks up the line, current flows through the extension's
        network hybrid/voice circuit, powering the earpiece and microphone.
        This current flow turns on the optocoupler, grounding its output,
        which signals the PIC's firmware the line is in use. 

        Or, if the line is on Hold because the Hold relay (K1) is energized,
        this shunts the Hold resistor (R1) across the line, keeping current
        flowing across Tip/Ring, keeping the Line Detect optocoupler engergized.

        When the line is idle, the optocoupler is OFF, and its open collector
        output is pulled high to +5V by one of the 5.6K resistors in RN1,
        causing the PIC chip to see the signal as logic 1 when the line
        is idle.

        When the line is in use or on Hold, the optocoupler is ON, and its
        output is pulled to ground, causing the PIC chip to see the signal
        as logic 0 when the line is in use.

        The PIC chip uses this signal to manage the extension lamps
        and the hold condition for the line.

        4.1.3 CPC Detection
        -------------------
        When the central office detects the remote caller hung up,
        it briefly opens the Tip/Ring circuit for about 1/2 a second.

        If this happens while a line is on Hold, the Line Detect circuit
        no longer sees loop current, causing the PIC chip to see no line
        current, and drops the call out of Hold, automatically freeing up
        the line for new calls.

        4.1.4 Holding A Call
        --------------------
        The CO detects a line is in use the same way we do; detecting
        current flow across Tip and Ring.

        To put a call "on hold", one only needs to shunt a low value
        resistor across Tip and Ring so that when the extension hangs
        up, the CO still sees current flowing through the resistor, 
        keeping the call active.

        Once on Hold, the KSU flashes the lamps on all extensions for 
        that line, holding a 60 ohm 1 watt resistor (R1) across the line
        via the energized Hold relay (K1).
        
        The description of how the Hold button is detected is described below.

    Next, the circuit design should consider 1A2 phone inputs and outputs.

    4.2 Phone Outputs
    -----------------
    The phones only have one "Output" signal to the KSU:

        4.2.1 The A Lead ("A Sense")
        ----------------------------
        A 1A2 phone's only output signal to the KSU is a simple switch closure
        for the A lead.

        When any extension's line button is down and the phone off hook,
        the A lead for that line will be shorted to ground. So for each line,
        the wires connected together would be:

            line #1: pins 27 (W-O) and 2 (O-W)
            Line #2: pins 30 (W-G) and 2 (O-W)
            Line #3: pins 33 (R-G) and 2 (O-W)
            Line #4: pins 36 (BK-BL) and 2 (O-W)
            Line #5: pins 39 (BK-BR) and 2 (O-W)

        Since the 25 pair 1A2 extension cables can be quite long (up to 1000 feet)
        and has the potential to pick up ring currents, line noise and various 
        other unwanted interference, we isolate the A lead from the PIC chip's
        input port with an optocoupler (IC5).

        When no extension has the line selected, the A Lead is an open circuit
        (floating). Since it's directly connected to the A1 optocoupler (IC5),
        the optocoupler is OFF. The optocoupler's open collector output connects
        directly to the PIC chip's RC5 ("L1 A SENSE") input, which when off is
        open (floating), and is pulled high to +5 by one of RN1's 5.6K resistors.
        The PIC firmware sees this condition as logic 1.

        When someone at an extension picks up the line, the A Lead is grounded.
        This turns on optocoupler A1, its darlington output goes to ground,
        causing the PIC chip to see this condition as logic 0.

        When someone puts a call on Hold or hangs up, the A Lead opens.
        To tell the difference between Hold or Hang Up, the PIC chip compares
        the A Lead and Line Detect inputs:
            
            * On Hold, when the user presses the Hold button down, the A Lead immediately
              opens first, while Tip and Ring continue to be connected to the phone's hybrid,
              keeping the Line Detect sensing current. In the short interval before the user
              releases the Hold button (causing the line buttons to release), the PIC chip
              needs to detect this condition and energize the Hold relay (K1) to shunt the Hold
              resistor across the line to put the call on Hold, so by the time the user releases
              the Hold button (causing the line button to release, disconnecting the phone's
              hybrid from continuing to draw current across Tip/Ring), the Hold resistor now
              keeps the line drawing current so the call doesn't drop.

            * On Hang Up, both A Lead and Line Detect optocouplers turn off simultaneously.
              The PIC sees both "A SENSE" and "LINE DETECT" in the idle condition, turns
              off the lamps for the line, and resets the line to being idle.

        So the A Lead sensing, in combination with Line Detect, is used to control 
        these conditions:

            1) Directing the Hold relay to be either on or off
            2) Directing 1A2 lamps to be on, off, or flash

    So that covers the phone's only output.

    4.3 Phone Inputs
    ----------------
    The phones have several inputs:

        * 4.3.1 - Lamp (Visual)
        * 4.3.2 - Bell (Audible)
        * 4.3.3 - Buzzer (Audible)

    The on board PIC chips control these signals to the phones by way of a ULN2803
    darlington transistor array to boost the PIC chip's output current. These signals
    control power transistors and relays to interface to these 1A2 devices:

        * An IRF9530 power transistor (Q1) drives the Line #1 lamps
        * The relay K3 drives bell ringing for Line #1
        * The TIP125 power transistors (Q7-Q10) drive the buzzers for the 4 extensions

    4.3.1 Lamps
    -----------

    The line lamps in 1A2 phones are all wired in parallel. A single IRF9530 transistor
    (Q1) controls the Line #1 lamp in all extensions, lighting them simultaneously to
    indicate if a line is in use, or flashes the lamp for incoming calls or calls on Hold.

    When the KSU wants to light the Line #1 lamps, the IRF9530 power transistor (Q1) is
    energized by control of the PIC firmware, providing a strong +12V signal to power
    the lamps.

    The PIC output RA0 ("L1 LAMP") drives a ULN2803 darlington transistor to actually
    turn on the IRF9530 transistor. When flashing is needed, the PIC firmware handles
    the timing of turning the transistor on and off.

    4.3.2 Bells
    -----------
    The bells are used for ringing phones when there's an incoming call on a line.

    The bell in each extension needs between 70 VAC and 105 VAC to ring. The AC frequency
    is usually 30Hz for a 1A2 systems, but can also be 20 Hz for a 'calmer' sounding ring.

    The bell ringing voltage and frequency is NOT supplied by the KSU circuit board; 
    this must be provided by an external "Ring Generator" (or "Frequency Generator")
    that the KSU circuit board simply switches as needed to ring the bells.

    When the PIC chip senses an incoming call on Line #1 via the Ring Detect optocoupler (IC1),
    it turns on the "L1 RING RLY" output, which by way of the ULN2803, turns on the coil of
    "L1 RING" relay (K3), which switches the ring generator's power out to the exensions
    programmed for ringing by SW1's diode matrix. A current limiting 300 ohm 1 watt resistor 
    (R27 in REV-G, R28 in REV-G1) is connected in series with the ring current (recommended
    for most ring generator configs).

    The PIC chip also energizes Q4 whenever ANY line is ringing, providing 12 volts to 
    power any low voltage ring generator devices (like the PowerDSINE or BlackMagick),
    so that these devices only receive power during ringing, and are off the rest of the time.
    This 12 volt output can also be used to drive an external relay to switch 115 VAC power
    for AC powering ring generators, such as the 118A, so that the device is only on 
    during ringing.

    4.3.2.1 Programmable Ringing
    ----------------------------
    Making "ringing programmable" was one of the design goals.

    Ringing for each extension is programmable by the SW1 diode
    matrix, allowing the installer to configure which extensions
    will ring for each of the two lines.

    1A2 phones have a separate wire pair just for the 70-105 VAC ringer
    (pins 20/45) and a separte pair for the 10 VAC buzzer (pins 17/42).

    Since we are in charge of ringing, the "ring detect" circuit needs
    to do at least two things:

         1) Flash the lamps for the line that's ringing, so the caller knows
            which line to answer

         2) Ring the appropriate extension phone's bells (or buzzers)

    The Bell System Practices (BSP's) recommends diodes be used to
    "program" ringing, so that different extensions can ring depending
    on which line is ringing.

    In our case, we provide a full diode network, and use DIP switches
    to control the 70-105 VAC ring signal. A similar arrangement is
    used to control which buzzers are used during ringing, such as if
    a ring generator is not present, but audible signaling is needed.


    4.1 GENERAL BOARD LAYOUT
    ------------------------

    The board is broken out into discrete sections, so that each can be
    separately populated and debugged easily.

    To access all feautures, 2 separate power supplies need to be provided:

        12 VDC - for board logic and phone lamps
        70-105 VAC / 30Hz - for phone ringing

    Components for unused sections can be left unpopulated if need be.
    Examples:

        LINE 2
        ------
        If a Line2 isn't needed, all components can be left out of the
        "LINE 2" section of the board:

             o The Hold relay
             o The two LDA110 optocouplers
             o The 160 ohm Hold resistor
             o The IRF9530 "L2 LAMPS" transistor (Q2) and related resistors R9 + R11
             o The "LINE 2 STATUS" led and resistor R10
             o The 4 telco line conditioning components R12, R13, C3, R14.

        90 VAC RINGING
        --------------
        90VAC ringing is optional, since "ringing" can also be provided
        by the buzzers using the BUZZ CALL section.

        If 90VAC ringing won't be used, all components can be left out
        of the "BELL CALL" section of the board, namely: the "90VAC
        RINGER POW" connector, 8 diodes and 8 position DIP switch.

        INTERCOM
        --------
        If intercom features aren't needed, all components can be
        left out of the "ICM VOICE BATT" and "INTERCOM DIALING" sections.

        BUZZERS
        -------
        If buzzers won't be used at all, either for intercom notifications
        or incoming calls ("BUZZ CALL"), then you can leave out:

            * All the TIP125's under "BUZZERS"
            * The ULN2803 (IC12)
            * The 10K resistor network  (RN2)
            * The four diodes D22-D25
            * The 10 LED bar graph (IC13)
            * The 8 position DIP switch (SW1)

    4.x 1A2 PHONES
    --------------
    Sometimes the internal wiring of the 1A2 phones need to be modified to
    work properly with the KSU.  So before connecting up the phones, verify
    the phones are wired as described in the "User Manual" installation section.

    Usually the only wires that need modification, if any, are the buzzer and bell.
    This board expects all phones to be internally wired the same way (if
    plugging directly into the board), where:

        o The phone's bell is wired to the 20/45 pair (yel/slt, slt/yel).
        o The phone's buzzer is wired to the 17/42 pair (orn/yel, yel/orn).

    For more info on the default internal wiring of 1A2 6 button phones, see:
    http://seriss.com/people/erco/1a2/2564-pinout.html

    The 1A2 6 button phones differ from regular phones in the following way:

        A 50 pin cable instead of a single wire pair. This is because 1A2
        phones are capable of accessing any of 5 lines, and include additional
        control signals regular phones don't have; lamps, switch closures,
        bell and buzzer options.

        The 5 line buttons each have a 10VAC lamp, a separate wire pair
        for each. With this 1A2 card, 12VDC is used to run the lamps,
        which at that voltage is around ~42 mA per lamp.  So with a max
        of 4 phone sets, if Lines 1, 2 and 5 are all lit at the same time,
        that's (3 x 4 x 42mA) = 504mA current draw for just the lamps.

        When a button is down and the receiver is lifted, that button's
        switch closes the "A lead" pair for that line. The KSU board uses
        this switch closure for logic to handle its internal logic.

        The "bell" (ringer), which singals people there's an incoming
        call, has its own separate wire pair, and is NOT connected in
        any way to any of the Tip/Ring pairs. It needs a separate 90VAC
        supply to ring the phone's bell. This is because ringing can be
        programmed at the KSU to ring for more than one line, and ringing
        can happen while someone's already on a call.

        The "buzzer", used for intercom signalling, has a separate wire
        pair and runs on 18VAC. With this board, 12VDC at 60Hz is used.

    Other than that, the internals of the phone are mostly the same as
    the old home phone sets; there's a voice hybrid, a switch hook,
    a carbon-mic based handset, a touchtone dial, and tip/ring enters
    the phone.

    4.2 TELCO LINE
    --------------
    In the following description, voltages are approximate and vary by location.

    The lines from the telephone company idle at 48 VDC.
    Incoming calls presents 90VAC/20Hz on the line.

    When someone picks up the call, the phone's hybrid presents a current draw
    sensed by the phone company, which switches to a 6 VDC talk voltage that powers
    the talk circuit of the phone.

    4.3 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION
    -----------------------

    Electronics are used to achieve the various needs of a 1A2 phone system:

        o Controls lamps, bells, buzzers on the phones to give visual
          and audio feedback.

        o Manages line state detection and Hold functions

        o Provides a local intercom system, including Touch-Tone buzzing
          of extensions.

    Simple circuitry is used to achive this; optocouplers (LDA-110),
    DPST 12 volt relays (DS2Y-S-12VDC), linear comparitors (LM339),
    power transistors to control lamps and buzzers (TIP125), and some
    DTMF circuitry (MT8870, 7445).

    Linear comparitors are employed to serve a variety of functions..
    they are used as inverters, "relaxation oscillators", logic gates,
    signal converters, isolation gates.

    By design, no computers or software is used in this circuit.

    To understand the schematics, one needs to understand the phone
    company's unusual relay symbols; this is a single pair of 
    Normally Open (NO) and Normally Closed (NC) RELAY TERMINALS
    with a Common (C) connection:

            <img src=images/fig-relay.png>

    ..and the RELAY COIL is represented this way:

    ..and when the relay is ON, current flows through the circuit this way,
    as shown in <font color=green>green</font>:

        <img src=images/fig-relay-on.png>


    4.3.1 - Phone Lines: Tip and Ring
    ---------------------------------
    The circuit senses the telephone line for signals from the central
    office (CO) and the local phone extensions (EXT) or 'stations' (STA).

    Optocouplers are used to sense the phone line "tip" and "ring" pair;
    one senses if the line is in use ("Line Detect"), the other senses
    ring voltage if there's an incoming call ("Ring Detect").

    Since the board supports two incoming lines, there's a separate pair
    of optocouplers to sense these states for each line.


        4.3.1.1 LINE SENSE CIRCUIT
        --------------------------
        The board needs to be able to detect when a line is in use for
        two purposes:

            o To light the line's lamp indicating the line is in use
            o Break a call out of "Hold" if the remote hangs up

        For this, a single optocoupler is connected in series with
        the line to detect current flow through the phone hybrids
        or the hold resistor (if a call is on hold).

        An LDA-110 optocoupler can pass AC or DC through them, due
        to the use of back-to-back LEDs on the input.  In this way
        it can detect current flow without affecting the call.

        When phones are not in use (hung up) and no calls are on hold,
        there is no current flow across Tip/Ring, so the optocoupler's
        LEDs (on the LDA110's) are both off.

        When one or more phones are off-hook for a line, or a line is
        on Hold, the "Line Sense" optocoupler operates, presenting a
        grounded output at pin 5, which directly powers the Line Sense
        "L" relay.

        <img src=images/fig-line-sense.png style="border: 1px solid black;">

        The "L" relay operates whenever the line is in use, either
        when one or more extensions are offhook, or if a call is on hold.

        When the "L" Line Sense DPDT relay *operates*, the relay's two
        internal switches each handles separate things:

            o Provides a possible path to 12V to control the phone extension's
              lamps (Depending on the state of the "A" relay)

            o Provides a possible path for Tip/Ring to the Hold Resistor,
              putting the call on Hold. (Depending on the state of the "A" relay)

        When the "L" relay is *idle*, the relay's two internal switches
        each handles separate things:

            o Provides a possible path that turns off the phone extension's
              lamps, or provides a path to an alternating 1 Hz signal that
              can flash the lamps indicating an incoming call, depending
              on the state of the "A" relay and the combination of the
              "RING DETECT" and "RING STRETCH" circuit.

            o Prevents any possible path to the Hold resistor between
              Tip/Ring. (Depending on the state of the "A" relay)

        So the "L" relay follows the "Line Sense" optocoupler, 
        and the "A" relay follows the A lead.. that being the state
        of all buttons for a particular line, connected in series.

        The "A" relay operates whenever a button is pressed and the
        phone for that extension is offhook. The A lead opens
        when someone hangs up or presses down on the Hold button.

        4.3.1.2 RING DETECTION
        ----------------------

        While idle, the LDA110 "Ring Detect" optocoupler is off,
        providing an open output on pin #5.

        This output is pulled high by a 50K resistor, which after
        passing through a small noise-rejecting RC circuit, causing
        the inputs on two LM339 comparitors high, causing their outputs
        to both open:

            1) One comparitor's output controls a 2n3906 transistor
               which in turn controls a relay C. When the comparitor's
               output is open, the transistor is off, the relay is off,
               so no ringing is supplied.

            2) The other comparitor driving the "Ring Stretch" circuit
               will be off, leaving the Ring Flash (RIFL) output open,
               which by way of the contacts on relays L and A, provides
               an open circuit to the base of the lamp control transistor
               (TIP125-L1) off, causing all lamps to be off for that line.

        When a call arrives, ~90VAC arrives on the T/R pair from the
        Central Office (CO), which lights the LEDs in the "RING DETECT"
        optocoupler through a series resistor/capacitor across the line.

        While ringing is happening, the optocoupler provides a grounded
        output on pin 5, driving the inputs of both downstream LM339's
        comparitor's outputs low, which:

            1) Turns on the 2n3906 transistor in the "INCOMING CALL" circuit,
               turning on that line's ring relay for the duration of the AC
               ring voltage.

               This relay's contacts provide either 90VAC to drive the ringers
               on extensions programmed for ringing on that line, or provides
               a path from the "BUZZ OSCILLATOR" circuit's 60Hz 12v
               ground signal to buzz any buzzers programmed for ringing
               via the power transistors in the "BUZZER CONTROL" circuit.

               In either case, the ringing/buzzing directly follows the
               telco ringing.

            2) Triggers the RING STRETCH circuit, passing the 1 Hz flashing
               from the "RING OSCILLATOR" to reach the RIFL input on the
               L and A relays.

               This 1 Hz flashing signal continues to run during and between
               telco ring bursts, ensuring the lamps continue to flash between
               rings.

               When ringing from the telco stops, the 1 Hz flashing will continue
               for up to 7 seconds.

        4.3.2 HOLD CIRCUIT
        ------------------
        When a phone call is active, the "L" relay and "A" relay are
        both operating, because:

            o The "Line Sense" optocoupler is operating due to constant
              current flow detected through the phone's hybrid

            o The "A" lead is grounded by the phone's line button being down.

        When someone presses Hold, the A lead signal is interrupted, pulling
        ground from the A relay's coil, turning the relay off. But the phone's
        hybrid is still across the line, so the LINE DETECT circuit continues
        to see current, keeping the L relay operated.

        This combination (A relay off, L relay on) causes the logic of the two
        relays to:

            o Connect the "Hold Resistor" across the Station Tip/Ring pair,
              holding the line, keeping current flowing, and thus keeping
              the LINE DETECT circuit and L relay operating.

            o Connects the "Hold Lamp Oscillator" to the TIP125-L transistor,
              winking the lamps for that line at the 2 Hz rate.

        When the Hold button is released, the line button pops up, disconnecting
        the phone's hybrid from Tip/Ring.

        Because the "Hold Resistor" is now shunted across the line, the
        "LINE SENSE" optocoupler and L relay remain operating.

        "A" RELAY DELAY:
            The 220uF capacitor across the A relay's coil holds the A
            relay operating an extra few milliseconds when the A lead
            opens to prevent a "false hold" condition. This small delay
            ensures a quick hangup won't be mistaken for Hold.

            The hook switch on the phone is configured to first open
            Tip/Ring before opening the A lead, to prevent a false
            hold. One can see this if one hangs up slowly; first the
            "L" relay turns off, then the "A" relay.

        4.3.3 LAMP CIRCUIT
        ------------------
        The phone's lamps are incandescent bulbs that were designed to
        run properly at ~10 VAC.

        In this system, the lamps are run by 12 VDC, and consume approx
        40mA per lamp. So a 4 extension system may use approx 160mA per
        line (e.g. when Line #1 is in use, all 4 extension's lamps for
        Line #1 will be lit).

        If the extra 4 extensions are used, a total of 8 extensions
        would use up to 320mA.

        The TIP125 power transistor, which is turned on when its
        input is grounded, can handle that with very minor heating.

        Beyond that, a heat sink is recommended, or a TIP32 transistor
        with a 1K base resistor can be substituted for the TIP125 / 10K
        resistor.

        The lamps have 4 possible states:

            o Off (Idle)
            o Ring flash (line ringing)
            o Hold wink  (line on hold)
            o Continuous on (line in use)

        The combined logic of the two relays "A" and "L" control which of these
        4 possible states are active at any given time.

        Idle.
        -----
            When the line is idle, the relays are off, connecting the
            TIP125 transistor directly to the "RIFL" output of the
            "RING STRETCH" LM339:

                o For Line 1 that would be pin 2 of LM339-B.
                o For Line 2 that would be pin 2 of LM339-C.

            The RIFL output remains "open" when there's no ringing,
            so the TIP125 transistor remains off, and thus all the
            line lamps will be off.  The TIP125 has internal pullups
            that keep the base at +12, leaving the collector output
            open (off).

            The effective +12VDC current flow path is shown in GREEN:

    <img src=images/fig-lamp-idle.png>

        Ringing.
        --------
            When the line starts ringing, the L and A relays remain off
            (same as idle), continuing to connect the TIP125 to the "RIFL"
            output of the RING STRETCH circuit.

            But due to the presence of ringing, the RIFL signal starts
            oscillating, alternating from open/ground at a 1Hz rate,
            turning the transistor on and off, which flashes all the
            line lamps, giving a visual indication which line is ringing.

            The effective connection path of an OSCILATING 1HZ signal
            (transitioning between +12VDC and an open circuit) is shown
            below in GREEN:

    <img src=images/fig-lamp-ring.png>

        Hold.
        -----
            When the line is on hold,  the L relay is operating, the A
            relay is off, and together these present the input of the
            TIP125 transistor to the HOFL oscillator, which alternates
            between open and gnd at a 2Hz 80% duty cycle rate, causing
            all lamps for that line to "wink" at 2 Hz.

            The effective connection path is shown in GREEN:

    <img src=images/fig-lamp-hold.png>

        In Use.
        -------
            When the line is in use, the A/L relays are both operating,
            the A relay's contacts connect the TIP125 transistor's B input
            directly to GND, which turns on all the lamps for that line.

            The effective connection path is shown in GREEN:


    <img src=images/fig-lamp-inuse.png>

        4.3.4 RING PROGRAMMING
        ----------------------
        When a line is ringing, the output of the "RING DETECT" circuit
        drives an LM339 buffer (e.g. LM339-B4) to ground (schematic Pg#1),
        operating the "C" relay's 2N3906 transistor to go high during each
        ring burst, operating the "C" relay in the INCOMING CALL circuit
        (schematic Pg#3).

        The relay operates while ring voltage is present, so it opens
        and closes on each ring, passing the AC RING voltage to the
        phone ringers that have been programmed to ring via the SW2
        DIP switches.

        This board supports two kinds of ringing for incoming calls,
        each type handled by separate terminals on the C relay:

            o "Bell" calling to ring the phone's bells.
              This needs an external 90vac/30Hz ring generator.

            o "Buzz" calling to buzz the phone's buzzers.
              Uses built in 12v supply to buzz the phone's buzzers.

        Bell Calling
        ------------
            The contacts of the "C" relay connect 90VAC is then directed
            through a matrix of diodes and DIP switches which allow the
            installer to "program" which lines ring when a call comes in
            via the switch settings.

            The diode network prevent back currents, enabling the programming,
            but looses 1/2 of the AC wave used for ringing. This is normal
            on 1A2 systems, which are designed for either 1/2 cycle or full
            cycle ringing.

            When the ring relay is energized, the locally provided 90 VAC
            ring voltage is directed to the STA RG / STA RR pins on that
            extension. Assuming the phone's extension has a ringer wired
            across those pins, the phone will ring.

        Buzz Calling
        ------------
            The OTHER contacts of the "C" relay connect the 60 Hz output
            from the BUZZ OSCILLATOR circuit to a matrix of diodes and
            DIP switches which allow the installer to "program" which
            lines buzz when a call comes in via the switch settings.

            The 60 Hz signal is routed to the TIP125 transistors in the
            "BUZZER CONTROL" section, activating the buzzers programmed
            for buzzing when that line has an incoming call.

            When the transistor is energized on-and-off at 60 Hz, it clicks
            the buzzer at that rate, making the buzzing sound. The frequency
            of the buzzing is controlled by the BUZZ OSCILLATOR circuit.

            The transistor provides a path to +12 volts for the buzzers
            on Amphenol pin 17. The other side of the buzzers are tied
            in common to ground at Amphenol pin 42.

    4.4 INTERCOM
    ------------
        The intercom is provided on Line 5. This line is provided
        internally, and has nothing to do with the telco lines.

        The talk battery for this line is provided by the
        "ICM VOICE BATT" section of the board; two series 60 ohm resistors
        to +12 and ground respectively.

        A large 2200uF capacitor provides noise reduction on the line,
        so that any power noise on the +12 supply (e.g. flashing lamps)
        don't 'click' the ICM talk circuit.

        When the user presses the intercom Line 5 and picks up the handset,
        these things happen simultaniously:

            o The talk battery provided on the Tip/Ring pair finds its way
              to the hybrid of all extensions that are listening to this line.
              In this way, people can talk to each other.

            o The A lead is grounded, pulling the base of the TIP125 in the
              INTERCOM POWER circuit to ground, providing +12 on its output,
              which:

                  o Lights all lamps for Line 5

                  o Provides +12 to the 7805 5v regulator, powering the entire
                    INTERCOM DTMF DECODE circuit, powering the MT8870 and
                    7445 chips.

        If the user presses "1" on the TouchTone dial pad, extension #1's
        buzzer will buzz while the button is pressed, signaling the person
        at that extension to pick up Line 5 (which will be lit), and the two
        people can communicate.

        When the last person hangs up:

            o All load is removed from the talk battery, as all phone
              hybrids will be disconnected from the Tip/Ring pair.

            o The A lead becomes "open", pulling ground away from the
              base of the TIP125, causing all Line 5 lamps to go out,
              and the 7805 5v regulator will turn off, powering down
              the entire INTERCOM DTMF DECODE circuit, and MT8870
              and 7445 chips.

        Details regarding DTMF detection:

            Since DTMF detection is done for the intercom line only,
            there's no need for an isolation transformer.

            When the MT8870 chip detects someone has pressed a dial button,
            the 8870's StD output (pin #15) goes high, and the appropriate
            4 bit value is provided on the outputs.

            The goal is to turn a button press into supplying an 60Hz
            12 volt output on the appropriate TIP125 transistor.
            To do this, the circuit has to take into consideration:

                When the dial button is released, the 4 bit value
                of the last pressed button *remains* on the 8870's
                outputs. So we can't just drive the TIP125 transistors
                directly with these outputs; the outputs have to be
                gated by the 8870's StD output.

                Also, when a button is pressed, we need the TIP125
                transistors to not just turn on while the button
                is pressed, but needs to turn on/off at a 60Hz rate
                to run the buzzer.

            To achieve these two goals without lots of extra
            components, we:

                1. COMBINE the 12v 80hz oscillator output and the
                   5v MT8870's StD output (TTL +5 when a button is
                   pressed) to an LM339 comparitor, which gate +
                   clips the oscillator, the resulting output sent
                   to the MT8870's "TOE" input, the LM339's output
                   pulled high to +5v with a 10K, making the output
                   TTL compatible.

                2. TOE turns the 8870's 4 bit outputs turn on-and-off
                   at 60Hz when any TouchTone button is pressed.

                3. The 4 bit output of the 8870 is sent to a "1-of-8"
                   7445 TTL chip, whose 8 open collector, "active low"
                   outputs are connected directly to the base of a PNP
                   TIP125 through a series 10K resistor. The TIP125's
                   internal pullup resistor keeps the base at +12v.

                4. When a TouchTone button is pressed, the selected
                   7445's output pulls low /at 60Hz/, activating one
                   of the 8 TIP125 transistors at 60Hz, whose +12v
                   output opens and closes at 60Hz, directly driving
                   the selected phone extension's small buzzer.

            Focusing on the "gate + clip" in step #1, we use the 5v
            "StD" output from the MT8870 as a voltage reference to
            clip and gate the 0 - 12v oscillator output:

                 When StD is low, we want to turn the oscillator off.

                 When StD is high, we want the oscillator's on-and-off
                 output to pass through.

            The +5 output is conveniently almost exactly half of the 12v
            supply, making it a perfect voltage for a clipping reference.

            The output of the oscillator's open collector output
            is pulled up with a 10K resistor, resulting in an approx.
            60Hz square wave that swings from 0 ~ 11v, with a slight
            shark fin along the top of the signal, an artifact of
            the timing capaictor.

            This signal is cleaned up through a second gate in the
            LM339-E. But instead of just comparing the signal to a
            6 volt vref voltage divider to clip and clean it, we
            also compare it to the 5 volt StD signal, creating a
            sort of AND gate, to gate the oscillator's signal.

            To do this properly, some input processing is needed
            to raise the ground floor of the oscillator's output
            a volt or so, so when compared to the StD TTL output
            of the 8870, the oscillator is clipped off when StD
            falls to 0v. (We don't want the 339's two inputs to
            /both/ be 0v; the comparitor's output would oscillate)

            To raise the oscillator's ground, we first run it
            through a series 10K resistor. The output side of
            the resistor is then pulled high to 12v with a 100K
            pullup, raising it's ground, so the output swings
            from 11v to 1.1v at 60Hz (instead of 11v to 0v).
            The 1.1v "low" being just high enough to be
            clipped out when StD goes low.

            So to recap, the 60Hz oscillator raw output that
            swings 0-11v, with the shark fin:
                     __        __        __        __     __ 11v

                  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
                  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |

            The 60Hz is conditioned by a 10K series and 100K pullup to
            raise its ground slightly:

                     __        __        __        __     __ 11v
                    /  |      /  |      /  |      /  |
                   /   |     /   |     /   |     /   |
                  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |

                  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
                __|    |____|    |____|    |____|    |__  __ 1.1v
                                                          __ 0v

            The MT8870's TTL level StD output which is +5 when a button is pressed:

                        Buzz
                        ________________________________           -- 5v

            ___________|                                |_________ -- 0v

            Combining these last two signals into an LM339 comparitor results
            in both clipping (to clean up the shark fins) and gating the 60Hz
            oscillator. The resulting output (when pulled to +5 with a 10K):

            comparitor; the 12 volt 60Hz on the "+" input, and the 5 volt
            StD signal on the "-" input, the output being a 60Hz signal
            when StD is high. This combined signal is then sent to the
            8870's TOE input, which provides the appropriate binary pattern
            at an alternating 60 Hz frequency only while the dial button is pressed.

            So when idle (no button pressed), the TOE signal is low, causing
            the 8870's Q1/2/4/8 outputs to all float at high impedence.
            The 2k pullup resistors on the 8870's outputs let the 7445 see
            a 1111 value, causing the 7445's open collector outputs 1 thru 8
            to all be "open", causing the TIP125 PNP transistors to all
            remain off, as their bases will all be floating at 12 volts
            (due to their internal diodes), yielding a solid off condition.
            (They only turn "on" when their base is grounded)

            When a dial button is pressed, the binary value for the selected
            button is provided on the Q1/2/4/8 outputs, whenever the TOE input
            is high, which is at a 60 Hz rate only when a button is pressed.

            This in turn causes the 7445 1-of-10 decoder open collector
            outputs to do the same, driving the appropriate TIP125 transistor's
            base on/off at a 60Hz rate, which in turn drives that phone's buzzer
            at 60 Hz while that button remains pressed, and turns off when
            released.

            The TIP125 has a current gain (hFE) of around 1000x, so for instance
            a 2K base resistor would achieve 5 amp output: (11V/2000R)*1000gain=5A,
            more than any buzzer should need. 10k resistors would work as well:
            (11V/10000)*1000gain=1.1A, still more than sufficient.

            Internally, the TIP125's diagram shows an internal pullup resistor
            built into the darlington configuration, so its base floats at 12v.
            This 12v can propegate backwards from the base to the 7445, which is
            why the 7445 was specially chosen; its outputs are open collector,
            rated for up to 30v. So the 12v present at the TIP125's base won't
            cause issues for the 7445, even though it's TTL (0-5v).

    X.X INTERLINKED RINGING
    -----------------------
    In V1.3D firmware and / REV-J3 and older, ringing across boards
    was not synchronized, and ringing across boards was supported only
    by the addition of the "L1+L2 BELL" terminal block in REV-J3. Only
    lamp flashing is synchronized by signaling between boards over the
    SYNC_ILINK pin common between both boards.

    In V1.4 firmware / REV-J4, ringing across boards is synchronized
    by implementing an "Interrupter" (implemented in Interrupter.h),
    which handles the ring signal (on 1 sec, off 3 sec) and ring/hold
    flash signals. The signal's state on the PRIMARY is sent as an 8bit
    value every 10 main loop iters to the SECONDARY, which copies those
    signal states to its Interrupter, which drives its line lamps and ringing.

    The SECONDARY then replies with an 8bit data reply of its own, 
    sending binary state information about if any lines are ringing
    or on hold, so the PRIMARY board knows to start its interrupter.

    The V1.4 firmware uses the SECONDARY_DET input on CPU1 to determine
    if the firmware should be running in PRIMARY or SECONDARY mode,
    since the PRIMARY needs to know it starts all transmissions over
    SYNC_ILINK, and SECONDARY must take that data to drive the Interrupter,
    and must only react with state info of its own.

    IMPLEMENTATION OF BIDIR DATA TRANSMISSION
    -----------------------------------------
    Some features of the PIC were used to implement doing clean
    bidirectional data transmission of 8bit values over a single port:

        > WPU (Weak PullUps) are used on SYNC_ILINK to hold the line
          high so that the transmitter can pull it LOW when sending data.

        > IOC (Interrupt On Change) is used on SYNC_ILINK to interrupt
          the CPU when reading data from the board acting as a transmitter.
          Interrupts occur on both RISING and FALLING edges of SYNC_ILINK
          so that timing of how long signal remains low is possible.

        > TMR0 (hardware timer) is used to time how long SYNC_ILINK is
          pulled low:

              > When SYNC_ILINK goes low, receiver interrupt zeroes TMR0
              > When SYNC_ILINK goes high, receiver interrupt saves TMR0 value
                which is later used to determine if 1 or 0 was sent


        > Both boards leave SYNC_ILINK configured as an input
          until the PRIMARY decides to send data. 

        > PRIMARY switches SYNC_ILINK to output mode, transmits 8bits,
          then switches back to input mode

        > SECONDARY reads the 8bits from PRIMARY, switches to output mode,
          and sends its 8bit value, the switches back to input mode

    The transmission of data is implemented such that a '1' bit holds
    SYNC_ILINK low for a longer time than '0' the bits.
    Features used by the PIC.
          the first two bits being 'start' bits that are '1' and '0'
          which the receiver records the timing of for reference to
          later determine timing of the data bits that follow.

          the binary data one bit at a time
          using a longer delay for '1's vs '0's.

    4.5 OPTIONAL EXTENSIONS
    -----------------------
        The board supplies at least 4 extensions, and each can be dialed
        for buzzing directly using the TouchTone dial pad by dialing 1 through 4.

        But with 66 blocks, you can add an extra 4 extensions (for a total of 8)
        that can be buzzed by the TouchTone dial pad by dialing 5 through 8.

        See section 3.2 "EXPANDED WIRING: ADDING EXTRA EXTENSIONS #5-#8"
        above for more info.

    4.6 DEBUGGING
    -------------

       4.6.1 - STATUS LEDS
       -------------------

       There are various status LEDs and test points on the board.

       Each of the "LINE" sections has 3 status LEDs:

           "L" -- lights when the "L" relay is operating (Line Sense).

           "A" -- lights when the "A" relay is operating (A Lead)

           "Line Use" -- this LED reflects the phone's lamp for that line;
                         on when in use, flashing during ring, winks during
                         a call on hold.

       All LEDs are off when the system is idle.
       Picking up a line should light all three LEDs: "L", "A", and "Line Use".

       When an incoming call is ringing, "L" and "A" should be off,
       and "Line Use" should flash.

       When a call is on hold, the "L" light should be on, "A" should be off,
       and the "Line Use" light should wink.

       DEBUGGING WITH A METER
       ----------------------
       Using a meter, you can test for +12/Gnd at the power connector
       terminal screws. Ditto for the 90VAC/20Hz supply.

       Each line has a row of test points along the top of the board,
       to make it easy for a meter to access each of the 1A2 signals.
       For instance:

              Test Point  Description
              ----------  --------------------------------------
              STA T       The station "Tip" signal from the telco.
              STA R       The station "Ring" signal from the telco.
              STA AG      The A lead's common ground. This is tied to the board's 12 volt ground.
              STA A       The A lead for the line. This will be grounded when a phone has the line picked up.
              STA L       The station lamp's +12 volt supply. This is tied to +12.
              STA LG      The lamp output. Grounded when the lamp is on.

       To test the telco line for being idle, check for 48VDC across
       "STA T" and "STA R". (Note that 90 VAC may be present on these
       test points if the line is ringing)

       To test the A lead for a line, look for 12 volts between
       +12 and the "STA A" test point for that line (near the top of the board).

       To test the lamp output, look for 12 volts between +12 and STA LG.

       To test if the "ring detect" circuit is working, put a scope
       between +12 and pin#5 of the "RING DET" optocoupler (LDA110).
       When ringing is present, this should turn on and off.

       To test if the "line sense" circuit is working, put a scope
       between +12 and pin#5 of the "LINE SENSE" optocoupler (LDA110).
       When the line is offhook or on hold, this should show 12 volts.

       To test the hold lamp oscillator, you should see a steady 2Hz
       "winking" 12 volt output at all times on pins #1 and #2 of LM339-A.

       To test the ring lamp oscillator, you should see a steady 1Hz
       12 volt square wave output at all times on pins #1 and #14 of LM339-D.

       To test the 60Hz buzz oscillator, you should see a 60Hz
       12 volt square wave output on pin #14 of LM339-E when
       one of the dial buttons is pressed.

       To test the DTMF detector, you should see +5 volts
       on pin #15 of the MT8870 chip when someone is dialing
       any digit on the intercom line. Depending on which dial
       button is pressed, you should see 12 volts changing at 60Hz
       between +12 and the appropriate open collector output pin on
       the 7445.  (e.g. dialing "1" should ground pin #2, dialing "2"
       should ground pin #3..)

       To test the buzzer outputs, you should see +12 alternating at
       60Hz off the middle pin of the appropriate TIP125.

       To test the intercom voice battery, you should see
       between 6v and 12v across the "ICM T" and "ICM R"
       in the "ICM VOICE BATT" section, and should see the
       same across "STA T" and "STA R" on the "LINE 5 INTERCOM"
       row of test points. "T" should be positive, and "R" should
       be negative.


    4.7 EXAMPLES
    ------------

        4.7.1 - SYSTEM IDLE
        -------------------
        When the system is idle (waiting for a call or no one using a line),
        relays "A" and "L" are off, lamps are all out, ringers and buzzers are
        off. The state of the sensors:

            The "Ring Detect" optocoupler is "off" because there's
            insufficient AC current to light its LEDs through the
            R/C pair.

            The "Line Sense" optocoupler is "off" because there's
            no current flow across tip/ring (no hybrids are drawing
            current, and the hold resistor is switched out of the
            circuit due to the relay logic).

            The A leads on all phones are open.

            The intercom talk battery and touchtone decoder are all
            off because the intercom's A lead is open.

        When both "A" and "L" relays are "off", their relay contacts
        are arranged such that the output of the RING FLASH OSCILLATOR,
        normally at ground unless there's ringing, is directed to the
        LAMP OUTPUT TRANSISTOR, grounding it, causing the line's lamps
        to be off.

        Since RING FLASH OSCILLATOR is at ground when there's no rniging,
        the line's ring output (STA RG) is idle.

        4.6.2 - INCOMING CALL
        ---------------------
        When a line rings, the central office (CO) sends 1 second
        bursts of 90VAC, with ~4 seconds between each burst on the
        Tip (CO T) and Ring (CO T) pair.

        This drives the "Ring Detect" circuit, lighting the dual-LEDs
        of an LDA-110 optocoupler, energizing its internal darlington
        transitor for the duration of each ring burst.

        The output of "Ring Detect" circuit is split into two:

            1) Drives a "Ring Extension" circuit: a 2N3906 transistor
               who's output remains high during ringing, who's output
               is directed through a series of programmable DIP switches
               (to control which extensions should ring for this line),
               enabling the system's own 90 VAC ring voltage to ring
               the phone sets programmed for ringing.

               The pattern of ringing on the lines directly matches
               the Central Office's pattern of ringing, but using
               our own ring generator's voltage output.

            2) Drives a "Ring Stretch" timing circuit that holds the
               output low not only during ringing, but also between
               ring bursts.

               The output of this circuit is logically AND'ed with a
               continuously running 60 IPM square wave generated by
               the "Ring Lamp Osc" circuit.

               The output of these combined signals creates the
               on/off blinking pattern necessary to blink the lamps
               for the ringing line.

               This signal is presented to "normally open" contacts
               of both "L" and "A" relays, which are both still "off"
               during ringing, such that the signal causes the TIP-120
               "LAMP OUTPUT TRANSISTOR" to turn on and off in the same
               pattern, blinking the lamps on all extensions for this line.

        If no one answers the call, after the last ring burst stops, the
        "Ring Extension" circuit stops, and the "Ring Stretch" circuit
        will switch back to a ground state, extinguishing the lamps.

        During all of this, the "L" and "A" relays both remain off.

        4.6.3 - RINGING CALL ANSWERED
        -----------------------------
        If someone answers the ringing call, several things happen
        simultaneously:

            o A user picking up the line causes the combination of
              the phone's hook switch and depressed line button to:

                  1) Present the phone's "talk" hybrid across the line,
                     causing the Central Office to stop sending ringing,
                     and provide instead a 6VDC talk battery to the line.

                  2) Grounds the "A" lead (STA A) for this line

            o The "Line Sense" optocoupler is triggered on because
              it detects the 6VDC talk battery's current flow through
              the answered phone's hybrid, operating the "L" relay.

            o The grounded "A" lead operates the "A" relay.

            o The "Ring Detect" optocoupler turns off immediately
              due to the absence of ringing, causing the "Extension Ring"
              circuit to turn off, extinguishing audible ringing.

            o The absence of ringing will cause the timing capacitor
              of the "Ring Stretch" circuit to stop re-triggering,
              causing that circuit to run for no more than 6 seconds
              after the CO provided ringing stops.

            o The combined logic of the "A" and "L" relays redirect
              the input of the "Lamp Output Transistor" away from the
              "Ring Lamp Oscillator" output, and shunts it to +12 volts,
              keeping the lamps in the continuous "on" state while the
              call remains active.

              Any leftover output from the "Ring Lamp Oscillator"
              (up to 6 seconds due to the "Ring Stretch" timing circuit)
              will be ignored.

        NOTE: If the user answers the call and immediately hangs up within
        6 seconds, the line's lamps may return to flashing as if ringing,
        due to the 6 second "Ring Stretch" timing circuit still running
        itself out from the last ring.

        This small artifact could be avoided with a simple circuit
        modification that resets the "Ring Stretch" circuit as soon as
        the call is picked up, but currently this has not been done.

        If I remember correctly, the old 1A2 KSU's (circa 1980) had this
        same artifact, so for now I'm leaving it in.

        4.6.4 - PLACING CALL ON HOLD
        ----------------------------

        An active call is put on Hold when the user presses the Hold
        button, which first opens the A lead, then removes the phone's
        hybrid from Tip/Ring.

        Pushing the Hold button causes the A relay to turn off,
        dropping the Hold resistor across the Tip/Ring pair, immediately
        and effectively "holding the line" by drawing enough current
        flow to convince both the telco and the "Line Sense" circuit
        that the call is still active.

        The A relay going off also connects the "Hold Oscillator" output
        to the lamps for this line, causing them to wink at 120 IPM.

        When the user then releases the Hold button, the user's line button
        mechanically pops up, removing the phone's hybrid from the line,
        opening the station's Tip/Ring pair.

        Normally this would hang up the call, but because the A relay's
        logic dropped the Hold Resisior across the line, the line remains
        active.

        With the call now on "hold", one of two things can happen:

            I. SOMEONE PICKS UP THE CALL
            ----------------------------
            In the case of someone taking the call off hold, they press the line
            button and pick up the handset, which:

                  o Connects the extension's hybrid across Tip/Ring

                  o Closes the A lead, operating the "A" relay, which:

                      1) Removing the Hold resistor from the line
                      2) Returns the lamps to a "continuous on" state

            The call returns to a normal active state, the "Line Sense"
            continues to detect current now going through the phone's
            hybrid (instead of the Hold resistor), which keeps the "L"
            relay operating.

            II. THE REMOTE CALLER HANGS UP
            ------------------------------
            If the remote hangs up before someone retakes the call,
            the Central Office briefly sends a CPC signal (Calling Party
            Control), which briefly opens the Tip/Ring pair.

            This causes the "Line Sense" optocoupler to turn off,
            causing these events:

                 o The "L" relay to turn off, which:

                     1) Removes the Hold Resistor from the line
                     2) Stops the 120 IPM lamp from winking
                     3) Causes all lamps for the line to turn OFF.

                 o The A lead remains open (since the call was on hold),
                   so the "A" relay remains off.

            This essentially resets the system from "Hold" to the
            "Idle" state, ready to take new calls.

            This behaivor is important to prevent the system from
            remaining on hold even if no one is there, automatically
            freeing up the line to accept new calls.

        4.6.5 - HANGING UP AN ACTIVE CALL
        ---------------------------------
        When an extension hangs up an active call, several things happen
        simultaneously, returning the system to the Idle state:

            o The phone's hybrid is removed from the line, causing the
              telco to drop the talk voltage and return to the 48VDC line
              idle state.

            o The "Line Sense" optocoupler turns off because it
              sees no current flow through the line, turning off
              the "L" relay. This prevents the Hold Resistor from being
              used, and returns the lamps to monitoring the "Ring
              Detect" signal, which should be OFF when there's no ringing.

            o The A lead for that line opens, turning the "A" relay off.

        This leaves the system ready to receive new calls.


PARTS LIST
----------

    Parts are organized by section.

    Quantities are the actual needed. Pad these out when ordering,
    in case some parts are bad or for spares, especially of parts
    that might become hard to find. (e.g. MT8870, LDA110s, DS2Y relays, etc)

    All resistors are 1/4 watt unless otherwise specified.

    Digikey part numbers are /suggestions/, and were used during R&amp;D
    and testing. Other parts of similar rating may be used.

    ORDERING CONSIDERATIONS
    -----------------------
    When ordering parts, most parts can be generally sourced with lax
    tolerances, but some parts need special consideration.

        PARTS ON CENTRAL OFFICE CIRCUIT
        -------------------------------
        Parts connected to the Central Office (CO) circuit are susceptible
        to extreme electrical spikes and/or large voltage potentials due to
        storms (lightning), or interaction with live AC or large voltage
        potentials relative to ground.

        As such, these parts SHOULD be:

            o Flame retardant
            o Resistors should be of high wattage (1/2W or more)

        Parts falling into this category:

            o Hold Resistors

            o All parts on the CO side of the optocouplers

            o All parts involved in the Tip/Ring circuit

        CAPACITORS: POLARIZED VS. UNPOLARIZED
        -------------------------------------
        Capacitors without "+" markings /MUST/ be UNpolarized.
        Capacitors with "+" markings /can/ be polarized but don't have to be.

        DIODES
        ------
        There are 3 kinds of diodes used in this circuit.

        1. BUZZER PROGRAMMING DIODES ("BUZZ CALL" SECTION)
        -----------------------------------------------

            These diodes can be small signal diodes, like the 1N914
            (Digikey #1N914VSCT-ND).

        2. RELAY COIL KICK SUPPRESSION DIODES
        -------------------------------------

            These diodes are arranged "backwards" across all relay coils
            to prevent back currents when the relay switches off.

            These should be rated 10 times the supply voltage, so in the
            case of 12 volt relays, 120 volts or higher should be used.
            1N4003 (200v 1A), e.g. Digikey #1N4003-TPMSCT-ND.

        3. RING PROGRAMMING DIODES ("BELL CALL" SECTION)
        ------------------------------------------------

            The ring programming diodes must handle 90VAC/30Hz and peak voltages
            for the inductive load presented by the bell ringers.

            Bell System Practices recommends the Western Electric "446F" diodes,
            which have an NTE equivalent of NTE-5809, or a 1N5408. These
            are rated 3A 1000V V(RRM).  Digikey part# 1N5408DICT-ND is
            approximately equivalent ($0.32 each).

            Someone on the 1A2 board at Sundance Communications recommended
            IN4005 (1A / 600V) which is under spec of Bell Labs, but is probably
            more than sufficient, since the ringing voltages are local, not CO.
            (Digikey #1N4005-TPMSCT-ND, $0.10 each).

            NOTE 1: The silk screen diode diagram for the ring programming diodes
                    on the "REV B" boards are backwards. When soldering in the diodes
                    for these REV B boards, keep that in mind. The direction of the
                    diodes DOES MATTER, even though these are A/C signals. The ringers
                    tend to ring only on one side of the AC signal!

            NOTE 2: To properly ring 1A2 phones through diodes, the hybrid networks
                    on each extension must have the K wire moved to the A screw. This
                    takes the hybrid's internal capacitor out of the circuit, which
                    defeats the diode oriented ringing signal. This practice was
                    something done by the old bell system installers when diode
                    were used to program ringing.

        SOCKETS
        -------
        All IC chips SHOULD be socketed for proper servicing/debugging.

        The 2N3906 transistors SHOULD be socketed for servicing/debugging.

        TIP125 power transistors CAN be socketed if appropriate sockets
        are used.

        NO HEAT SINKS
        -------------
        The circuit is designed for components to run cool during use.
        Power transistors and voltage regulators should NOT need heat sinks.

        Any parts getting hot enough to need a heat sink indicates
        SOMETHING IS WRONG. Most likely causes:

                Wiring inside the phones
                Wiring between phones and board
                Metal objects are shorted across the back of the board

        PART SPECIFICATIONS: FLEXIBILITY
        --------------------------------

            o The HOLD RESISTOR is spec'ed at 160 ohms, but 120 may also be used.

            o The RING DET resistor speced at 56K can be 50K-60K.

            o The large female RJ21 connectors can be either "press fit"
              or solder style.  These connectors often have many monikers;
              "50 pin" or "25PR" (25 pair) telco connectors, Amphenol connectors.
              They are 100% compatible with "50 pin SCSI connectors". Just be
              sure the lead diameter and spacing is consistent with what the
              circuit board provides.

            o Transistors 2n3906 can be other PNP equivalents.
              It's recommended these be socketed.

              I've found one can order long SIP sockets, and simply cut
              them into 3 pin sections with wire cutters.

            o LDA110 optocouplers may also be other "AC INPUT" darlington optos.
              It's critical the opto's inputs have back-to-back facing LED diodes,
              to prevent introducing any kind of polarization or line imbalances
              to the phone circuit.

            o Darlington PNP power transistors (TIP125) for LAMPS and
              INTERCOM POWER can also be non-darlington PNP power transistors
              (like TIP32) if 1K base resistors are used. It is actually advised
              to use TIP32's if you're attaching more than 4 extensions, as TIP32's
              run cooler than the TIP125's under heavier loads.

              It is advised, however, to /only/ use TIP125's in the "BUZZER CONTROL"

            o The DIP switches may also be jumpers.

            o Power connections can be screw terminals, though pluggable connections
              are advised for easy servicing/board swaps.

            o Any capacitors marked with "+" can be either polarized OR unpolarized.
              Only caps without the "+" MUST be unpolarized.
