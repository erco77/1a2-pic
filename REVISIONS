Seriss 1A2 Single Board KSU - Board Revisions
(Revisions shown latest at the top, oldest at the bottom)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"REV H" (Sep 2019) Differs from "REV G1" in the following ways:
    > New input SECONDARY_DET on Cpu1/RC3 (currently unused)
    > New input SECONDARY_DET on Cpu2/RA5 (currently unused)
    > New onboard fuse
    > Trace clearances increased around some interlink pads
    > Small printing error:
      In board run "WELLPCB_REV-H-printed-09-16-2019", bottom silk revision marker
      said "G1" instead of "H". Fixed lay6 file + gerbers for next board run,
      (but left WELLPCB directory unchanged)

"REV G1" (Jul 2019) Differs from "REV G" in the following ways:
    > No impact on software at all
    > Added TIP125 surge suppression diodes D22-D25
    > Change surface mount resistors to through hole (SMT annoying to solder)
    > Repositioned R25, R26, and R28 (changed to R27) for easier soldering/lead trimming
    > Swapped component numbers for R28 <-> R27: regional sequential numbering
    > Moved C7 next to C5 + C6 for easier assembly
    > Moved JP5 to left of EXT1 for cable clearence
    > Increased INTERLINK connector pad size for *solder side only* (more surface area for soldering)
    > Increased overall pad size for JP3 & 4 (more surface area for soldering)
    > Slight enlarge of LED holes to allow red status leds to flush mount
    > Added extra pad holes for 60/1W and 300/1W resistors

"REV G" (Jun 2019) Differs from "REV F" in the following ways:
    > REV G added 'SYNC' I/O signal to allow two boards to keep their
      flashing signals in sync (Hold + Ring Flash). Mostly an INPUT,
      briefly switches to output to send short sync signal to "other" cpu.
      This ensures "slower" cpu autosyncs itself to "faster" one.
      See UpdateInterlinkSync() function for complete implementation.
    > LED through holes enlarged slightly allowing red CPU LEDs to flush mount
    > Some traces moved around for clearance issues, but no electrical changes

"REV F" and "REV F1" (May 2019) Introduced interlink feature, two cpus.
    Differs from "REV E" in the following ways:
    > Revision "F" was an internal "development only" board; "F1" is the release version.
    > Introduiced Interlink feature to support combining two boards for 4 lines/8 extensions
    > Introduced rotary dial support for extension dialing.
    > Now has two PIC chips; CPU1 and CPU2, each with separate firmware
    > CPU1 handles logic same as REV E's single CPU, but no longer handles MT8870 signals
    > CPU2 handles MT8870 signals and rotary dialing
    > HandleDTMF() function removed from CPU1 firmware, moved to CPU2
    > Dropped these components:
           * "REV E" JP2 removed  -- interlink handles this now
	   * "REV E" C4 removed   -- 2200uF filter capacitor (voice batt) was unused
	   * "REV E" 7445 removed -- made obsolete by use of PIC CPU2

"REV E" (Apr 2019) First version of board with PIC chip to handle logic.
    > Previous board used no CPUs, all analog/discrete circuitry.
    > This board included 8 buzzer transistors and no interlink feature.
